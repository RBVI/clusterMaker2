# This is git repository for the Cytoscape 3 clustering app: clusterMaker

## General TODO's
- Find the shortname of every algorithm that has been used to cluster the
    current network
    - Find the shortname of every algorithm [DONE]
- Find out when the SimpleClusterContext object in the SimpleRankTaskFactory is initialized

## Refactor TODO's
- Move the getAlgorithms from the SimpleClusterContext? SimpleCluster or corresponding TaskFactory's responsibility?
